psd is abundance (#/l/mm)  psd(depth,size,cast)
psd(:,:,isRide)  is the psd for Ride
psd(:,:,~isRide) is the psd for Revelle

psd_relunc is the relative uncertainty (fractional 0-1).  
  psd_relunc is 1/sqrt(Nparticles)=1/sqrt(psd*psdBinWidth*sampleVolume)
  as in 1/sqrt(psd(#/l/mm)*psdBinWidth(mm)*sampleVolume(l)))
  from https://github.com/britairving/UVP_plots_basic/blob/master/UVP_calculate_PAR_fields.m

station is the station number
station(isRide) would be the Ride stations
station(~isRide) would be the Revelle

castLabs is a cell with the ship specified along with the cast.


>> display(castLabs(12:15))
  4×1 cell array

    {'rev003' }
    {'rev004' }
    {'ride010'}

binInfo is a structure with information about the size bins.
